# Basic data types - Integers, Floats, Booleans, Atoms and Strings.

# Integers values like - 1,2,232,4343
# Floats values like - 10.0293934, 3837.4584852 and so on
# Boolean values are - true or false
# Atoms values are the one whose name is its value like :ok, :error, :conflict, :true, :false
# Strings values are - 'some string', 'some random string' and so on.

# Basic Operations.

# Arithametic - +, -, *, /
# Special two functions in elixir - if we want to get the divison and remainder of any two numbers,
# Elixir offers two special functions - div(valueone, valuetwo) and rem(valueone, valuetwo)
# Using "and" and "or" in elixir -
# 1. true and 42 - returns 42 as it validates the 42 as a true value
# 2. false or true - again pick any one which is true, true == true
# 3. 42 and true - this gives error as it expects left side to be true and right to be some value to check if true or not

# Comparison Operators - ==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, >=, <=

# I did not understand more about how any two values can be compared in elixir
# and how the heck is it compairing and giving results will check it back again

# String Interpolation

# name = "Sean"
# "Hello #{name}"

# String Concatenation

# name = "Sammy"
# "Hello" <> name
